## Overview

**ComfyUI-Autocomplete-Plus** is a custom node that provides multiple input assistance features for any text area in [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI). Currently, it supports Danbooru and e621 tags (e621 does not support some functions).

## Features

- **:zap:No setup required**: Automatically downloads CSV data optimized for Danbooru tags.
- **:mag:Autocomplete**: Displays tag suggestions in real-time based on your input as you type.
- **:file_cabinet:Related Tags Display**: Shows a list of tags highly related to the selected tag.
- **:triangular_ruler:Auto Formatter**: Automatically formats prompt text when the textarea loses focus, cleaning up extra spaces and commas.
- **:earth_asia:Multilingual Support**: Supports input completion in Japanese, Chinese, and Korean.
- **:computer_mouse:Intuitive Operation**:
    - Supports both mouse and keyboard operations.
    - Natural tag insertion that considers cursor position and existing text.
- **:art:Design**: Supports both light and dark themes of ComfyUI.
- **:pencil:User CSV**: Allows users to add their own CSV files for autocomplete suggestions.

## Installation

### ComfyUI-Manager

1. Search for `Autocomplete-Plus` in [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/Comfy-Org/ComfyUI-Manager), install the custom node that appears, and restart.
2. The necessary CSV data will be automatically downloaded from GitHub upon startup.

### Manual

1. Clone or copy this repository into the `custom_nodes` folder of ComfyUI.
   `git clone https://github.com/newtextdoc1111/ComfyUI-Autocomplete-Plus.git`
2. Launch ComfyUI. The necessary CSV data will be automatically downloaded from GitHub upon startup.

## Autocomplete

When you type in a text input area, tags that partially match the text are displayed in descending order of post count. You can select a tag with the up and down keys, and insert the selected tag by pressing Enter or Tab.

- Tag aliases are also included in the search. Japanese hiragana and katakana are searched without distinction.
- Tags are color-coded by category. The color-coding rules are the same as Danbooru.
- Tags that have already been entered are displayed grayed out.
- You can display Danbooru and e621 tags at the same time. You can also change the priority from the settings.
- Supports autocomplete for Lora and Embedding inputs. You can enable/disable this feature in the settings.
- Clicking the 📖 icon opens the tag's Wiki page. If a tag is selected via keyboard, you can open it with the `F1` key.

When you select any tag in a text input area, a list of related tags from the [Danbooru related tags API](https://danbooru.donmai.us/wiki_pages/help%3Aapi) is displayed. Results are cached on disk under `data/related-tags/` for 7 days. You can insert a tag by clicking it or by selecting it with the up/down arrow keys and then pressing Enter or Tab. The UI's position and size are automatically adjusted based on the caret.

- The panel defaults to below the current line (like autocomplete). If there is not enough space below, it opens above.
  - You can switch between vertical and horizontal display positions using the "↕️|↔️" button in the header.
- You can toggle the pinned state of the displayed related tags using the "📌|🎯" button in the header. To close the UI when pinned, press the Esc key.
- You can switch the related-tag sort between Frequency and Jaccard using the "Fr|Jc" button in the header. Each sort is cached separately.
- Clicking the tag in the header opens the tag's Wiki page.
- Tags that have already been entered are displayed grayed out. If you try to insert a grayed-out tag, the already entered tag will instead be selected.
- You can display related tags for the cursor position by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Space`.
- Related tags are cached under `data/related-tags/` for 7 days. Delete that folder to force a refresh. The first lookup (and lookups after expiry) requires internet access.
- Character and copyright tags show frequent general, character, and copyright tags by default. Disable **Appearance Tags for Characters** in settings to use Jaccard related tags instead.

## Auto Formatter

When a text input area loses focus (e.g., by clicking outside or pressing Tab), the prompt text is automatically formatted. This feature improves readability when editing large amounts of text.

Detailed behavior is as follows:
- Automatically adds a comma and space after each tag for proper separation
- Removes extra commas and spaces between tags
- You can manually trigger formatting using the keyboard shortcut `Alt+Shift+F` (keybinding can be customized in ComfyUI settings)
- You can enable/disable this feature in the settings

> [!NOTE]
> Auto-formatting is disabled for certain nodes to prevent errors.  
> Example: [Power Puter (rgthree)](https://github.com/rgthree/rgthree-comfy/wiki/Node:-Power-Puter) `code` field, [LoraLoaderBlockWeight (Inspire)](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack) `block_vector` field

## CSV Data

A basic CSV data file is required for autocomplete. It is built from [tantinevincent/tagdb-updater](https://github.com/tantinevincent/tagdb-updater) (`danbooru.csv` + `danbooru-ja.csv`) and is automatically downloaded and merged when ComfyUI is first launched after installation, so no setup is required.  
Japanese names come from Danbooru wiki `other_names` plus community translation CSVs. Post counts may differ slightly from the Danbooru website. Related tags are fetched from Danbooru and are not taken from this CSV.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The basic CSV contains both SFW and NSFW tags.

**danbooru_tags.csv**

This is a tag information CSV file for autocomplete, containing tag names, categories, post counts, and aliases (including Japanese). The column structure is the same as that used in [DominikDoom/a1111-sd-webui-tagcomplete](https://github.com/DominikDoom/a1111-sd-webui-tagcomplete): `tag,category,count,alias`.

The dump is generated weekly from Danbooru. Artist, copyright, character, general, and meta tags are included.

### e621 CSV

Currently, automatic download of CSV for e621 is not supported, so please manually place a CSV with the same structure as `danbooru_tags.csv` in the data folder with the name `e621_tags.csv`.
Related tags always use Danbooru's API (e621 related tags are not supported).

### User CSV

Users can also use their own CSV files. CSV files should be placed in the `data` folder according to the following naming convention:

- **CSV for Autocomplete**: `<danbooru | e621>_tags*.csv`

For example, you can add frequently used meta tags to the autocomplete suggestions by placing a file named `danbooru_tags_meta.csv` in the `data` folder.
A header row is not required. A browser reload is necessary to apply the changes.

**Example of meta tags:**
```csv
tag,category,count,alias
masterpiece,5,9999999,
best_quality,5,9999999,
high_quality,5,9999999,
normal_quality,5,9999999,
low_quality,5,9999999,
worst_quality,5,9999999,
```

When the browser is reloaded, you can check the list of loaded CSV files in the ComfyUI console log. If a file is not included in the log output, please verify that the file name follows the naming convention.

**Example of ComfyUI console log output:**
```
[Autocomplete-Plus] CSV file status:
  * Danbooru -> base: True, extra: danbooru_tags_meta.csv // If displayed here, meta tags can be autocompleted
  * E621 -> base: False, extra:
```

>[!NOTE]
> If there are multiple user CSV files, they are loaded in alphabetical order. If the same tag exists in multiple files, the one loaded first is retained. The basic CSV is loaded last.

### Bulk Tag Insertion (Pseudo "Chants")

By enclosing multiple tags with `""` (double quotation marks), you can insert frequently used tags in bulk.
This is similar to the **Chants** feature in [DominikDoom/a1111-sd-webui-tagcomplete](https://github.com/DominikDoom/a1111-sd-webui-tagcomplete?tab=readme-ov-file#chants).

For example, by preparing the following CSV, you can quickly insert corresponding tags by typing `<c:Basic-HighQuality>` or `<c:Basic-Negative>`.

**`danbooru_tags_chants.csv`:**
```
"masterpiece, best quality, high quality, highres, ultra-detailed",5,9999999,<c:Basic-HighQuality>
"(worst quality, low quality:1.4), normal quality",5,9999999,<c:Basic-Negative>
```

>[!TIP]
> * Text enclosed in `""` does not escape `()` (parentheses). Tags that originally contain parentheses should be written in the CSV with escaped parentheses. Example: `copyright_(series)` -> `copyright_\(series\)`
> * The alias column also supports `""`, allowing you to assign multiple aliases

## Settings

### Tag Source

> [!NOTE]
> The source of tag data such as Danbooru or e621 is called the "tag source".

- **Autocomplete Tag Source**: The tag source to display in the autocomplete suggestions. Select "all" to display all loaded tag sources.
- **Primary source for 'all' Source**: When `Autocomplete Tag Source` is set to "all", the tag source specified here will be displayed with priority.
- **Tag Source Icon Position**: Where to display the icon of the tag source. Select "hidden" to hide it.

### Autocomplete

- **Enable Autocomplete**: Enable/disable the autocomplete feature.
- **Max suggestions**: Maximum number of autocomplete suggestions to display.
- **Auto-Insert Comma**: Automatically insert a comma after tags when inserting from autocomplete.
- **Replace '_' with 'Space'**: Replaces underscores with spaces when inserting tags. This setting also affects related tag display.
- **String to add before artist tags**: Text to prepend when inserting an artist tag. For Anima models, specify `@`.
- **Enable Loras and Embeddings**: Display Lora and Embedding in the suggestions.
- **Use Fast Search**: Switch autocomplete suggestions search to fast processing (see [About Fast Search for Autocomplete](#about-fast-search-for-autocomplete) for details).

- **Auto Format Trigger**: Choose when formatting is applied.
  - **Auto**: Format automatically when leaving text field
  - **Manual**: Format only via keyboard shortcut (default: `Alt+Shift+F`)
- **Use Trailing Comma**: When enabled, ensures all lines end with a trailing comma when formatting. If disabled, removes trailing commas.
- **Trim Surrounding Spaces**: When enabled, trim any blank lines or spaces from the beginning and end of the prompt.

## Advanced Settings

### Disabling CSV Update Check on Startup

By default, ComfyUI performs CSV file update checks and downloads at regular intervals during startup.
When starting in an environment without internet access, startup may be delayed until a timeout occurs.

You can skip the check process during ComfyUI startup by following these steps:

1. Start ComfyUI once with this custom node installed to generate the `csv_meta.json` file.  
  The `csv_meta.json` file is created directly under this custom node's folder.
2. Open `csv_meta.json` in a text editor and change the value of `check_updates_on_startup` from `true` to `false` and save.  
  If `check_updates_on_startup` does not exist, add it under `version`.

**`csv_meta.json` after modification:**
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "check_updates_on_startup": false,
  ...
}
```

**Additional notes:**
- The check process will not be performed until the value of `check_updates_on_startup` is changed back to `true` or the `version` is switched.
- Even when `check_updates_on_startup` is `false`, manual checking is still possible by pressing the `Check CSV updates` button in the Autocomplete Plus settings.

## More details on how it works

### About Fast Search for Autocomplete

In `v1.3.0`, Added a fast search feature functionality to autocomplete. By enabling this function in the settings screen, tag search processing during text input operates faster, improving responsiveness.  
While fast operation can be expected in any scenario, I particularly recommend **enabling** it in the following use cases:

- When the loaded CSV files contain a large number of tags or aliases. This is especially useful when the total number of tags exceeds **100,000**.
- When using natural language instead of comma-separated tags in prompt input.

**Browser startup behavior**

Fast search requires tag index building and is not available immediately after browser startup. The conventional search process is used until building is complete.  
As of `v1.3.0`, The notification when building is completed is displayed only in the browser's developer tools. This is planned to be improved in future versions.

For example, when index building for approximately 220,000 tags is completed, the following log is recorded:

```
[Autocomplete-Plus] Building 221787 index for danbooru took 9398.70ms.
```

> [!NOTE]
> - Index building occurs in the background even when fast search is disabled in settings
> - Fast search uses the full-text search library [nextapps-de/flexsearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch)

## Known Issues

### Performance

- Due to the large size of the CSV files, browser startup time may be longer.
- It consumes memory to operate quickly in the browser. This should not be an issue on machines with specs capable of running ComfyUI.

### Autocomplete

### Related Tags
- Cannot retrieve the correct tag when clicking on a dynamic prompt like `from {above|below|side}`. This is because the exact tag is not determined until the wildcard processor is executed.
